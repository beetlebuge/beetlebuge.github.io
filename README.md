This assignment included us using an API from weather.gov and creating a visual forecast of the temperatures for that city.
I did anchorage, and included some additional colors to represent the temperatures and have it look more visually appealing.


**Composition Creator**

For this assignment, we had to create a program that made squares/rectangles of varying sizes that displayed different colors.
I decided to make mine various shades of green, and let it run for about 10 seconds. I was striving for more squares on the
edges and of smaller size, which ended up working in this case.


**Rubber Duck Guessing Game**

In this assignment, we had to transform a random number generator into a guessing game where you have to guess a certain number of ducks.
Each attempt is randomized, and you were allowed to put in whatever picture of duck you desired, I put in this random one I got off of
google images. This was one of the more fun assignments in my personal opinion.

**Image Detector**

This assignment revolved around AI trying to detect what an image was based off of what we put into the image box.
I customized my version with new colors, making the UI slightly more appealing on the eyes and overall giving it a
bit of a glow-up. I really enjoyed this assignment!

**Counter-Strike 2 Player Numbers Week Report**

This was by far my favorite thing I have made in this class, and it's also the one I'm most proud of. For this project, we had to use
an API from somewhere for this assignment. Steam has a lot of public APIs, and so do many other sites based around Steam's Web API.
Because of this, I was able to get an API for the player numbers of the videogame Counter-Strike 2, and displayed its player count
over the course of a week. It also displays the hours and when the player count rose/fell using a graph to visually represent the
numbers over the course of a week.
